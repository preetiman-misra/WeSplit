# WeSplit

A restaurant bill splitting application, based on a tutorial by Paul Hudson (Hacking With Swift)

## Objective
The objective of this project was to create an app that allows a person to enter a check amount, the number of people dining and the preferred tip percentage in order to get the amount payable per person. This is not an original project and was created based on a YouTube tutorial series by Paul Hudson.

Thank You <3
